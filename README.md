# Capstone 3 Proposal

Brent Thayer


For this final capstone, I would like to improve upon my last capstone.  The main area I am thinking might help would be to remove the bones and bone shadows in the x ray images.  Building and applying this type of filter seems very challenging, and would probably be the majority of the project.  

To top it off though for my MVP, I would like to also encorporate a COVID class in addition to no finding and pneumonia.  Initially I would like to try and work with the architecture I built for the previous project since I got pretty good mileage out of it.  If this doesn't pan out, I would like to explore some transfer learning options.
