# Capstone 3 Proposal

Brent Thayer

## Idea 1
Continue off of my previous capstone with chest xrays, but train a model with a larger dataset and 14 labels.

## Idea 2
Another type of continuation from the previous capstone.  use an auto encoder to eliminate bone shadow from chest x-ray images, which could lead to a better classification model.  Maybe even combine this with idea 1.

## Idea 3
Train a model to recognize simple sign language (letters), and build an app to display these predictions in real time.
